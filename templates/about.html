            <h4><center>Our Mission</center></h4>
            <p>
                BorrowBuddy with a simple mission: to make student life more affordable and sustainable. We noticed that students often buy items they only need for a short time, like a specific textbook, a calculator for an exam, or a piece of sports equipment. Meanwhile, other students have these exact items sitting unused.

            <h4><center>How We Help</center></h4>
            <p>
                Our platform connects these students. By creating a trusted community for peer-to-peer lending, we help students save money, reduce waste, and get access to the things they need, right when they need them. Whether you're looking to borrow or lend, BorrowBuddy makes it easy and safe to share within our college community.
